# **Medical Image SaaS Application**

## **Overview**
This SaaS application aims to address the challenges faced by healthcare lab technicians when handling medical images. It provides tools for annotating regions of interest, precise measurements, geometric calculations, and image manipulation. The application supports common formats such as PNG and DICOM, making it an efficient and intuitive solution for diagnostics and treatment planning.

## **Key Features**
1. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Designed with **Tailwind CSS** for a neat and clean UI.
   - Support for **dark mode/light mode** for better usability.

2. **Image Manipulation Tools:**
   - Crop, zoom, pan, adjust brightness/contrast, and perform window/level adjustments.
   - Built using **Konva.js** for interactive and efficient image editing.

3. **DICOM Image Support:**
   - Upload and view DICOM images.
   - Extract and display metadata such as patient name, study date, and modality.
   - Asynchronous loading for large DICOM files.

4. **Pixel-to-Real-World Measurement Conversion:**
   - Convert pixel distances into real-world units like millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm).
   - Leverages DICOM metadata such as pixel spacing for accurate scaling.

5. **Optimized Performance:**
   - Fully responsive and optimized for various devices.
   - Efficient state management using **React Context API** or **Redux**.

6. **Dockerized Deployment:**
   - Docker containerization for seamless deployment.
   - Includes a `docker-compose` file for provisioning the application.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Code Language:** TypeScript (optional if you're not using it yet)
- **Frontend Framework:** ReactJS
- **Styling Framework:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** Naive UI or Material-UI (as an alternative)
- **Image Manipulation:** Konva.js
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Preferred File Formats:** PNG, DICOM

## **Features in Detail**

### **1. Image Manipulation Tools**
- **Cropping:** Allows selection of specific regions of interest.
- **Zooming & Panning:** Enables focusing on specific details within the image.
- **Brightness/Contrast Adjustment:** Enhances visibility for diagnostics.
- **Window/Level Adjustment:** Tailors the image view for better insights.

### **2. DICOM Image Handling**
- **Metadata Display:** Extracts and shows patient name, study date, etc.
- **Multi-Layered Image Support:** Renders multi-frame DICOM files.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages for unsupported or corrupted files.

### **3. Real-World Measurement Conversion**
- Converts pixel distances into physical measurements using metadata like pixel spacing.
- UI allows intuitive selection of measurement points and displays accurate results.

## **Challenges and Assumptions**
### Challenges:
1. Rendering large DICOM files efficiently.
2. Ensuring pixel-to-real-world measurement conversion accuracy.
3. Building interactive image manipulation tools without performance bottlenecks.

### Assumptions:
1. DICOM files contain valid metadata, such as pixel spacing, for accurate scaling.
2. End users are familiar with basic image manipulation workflows.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Advanced Annotation Tools:**
   - Add support for freehand drawing, rectangles, and polygonal regions of interest.
- **AI-Powered Features:**
   - Integrate AI models for automated diagnostics and anomaly detection.
- **Cloud Integration:**
   - Enable cloud storage for image uploads and sharing.
- **Collaborative Tools:**
   - Support for team annotations and real-time collaboration.

## **Running Tests**
1. Run unit tests using:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. For end-to-end testing (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright):
   ```bash
   npm run e2e
   ```
